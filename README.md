Repository por JT's website.

## Status

Navigation menu is now responsive and works for both mobile and desktop. Content is done for homepage in english versions and is responsive. Background
image has to be added.
An autoplaying video is supposed to display in the second content card but as it's, for now, too heavy to host without LFS it won't show up here.

## Issues

Folder structure needs updating. Videos, images and fonts need to go in a resource folder.

Language change option on mobile isn't immediately visible. The user has to open the menu to see it. That isn't ideal. A better way has to be found, but for now this is what we have.
