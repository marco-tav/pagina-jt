                    <p>A workflow based on seismic information assisted by wells intended to predict the subsurface distribution of those properties that best describe the behavior of the reservoir when set in production. The output of the system, provided that a good interpretation procedure is applied, must lead to maximize the chances of drilling success.​</p>
                    
                    <p>There is not a unique workflow, it is designed for each case according to the objectives and the available information instead. Anyway, some common elements can be distinguished:​</p>
                    
                    <p><b class="lead">First Transform,</b> normally associated to seismic inversion. Here, the subsurface distribution of rock elastic properties is estimated from seismic amplitude, although it takes –usually from wells- a priori information of low trend that is absent in seismic.​</p>
                    
                    <p><b class="lead">Second Transform,</b> the distributions of reservoir properties are derived by the application of relationships built up from wells to the elastic properties previously obtained in the First Transform.​</p>
                    
                    <p><b class="lead">Quantitative Interpretation,</b> a sequence of procedures that by the integration of the reservoir properties distributions with the rest of information allows mapping and classification the reservoir into zones according to risk level. Its results are key in decision making for next wells positioning.​</p>
                    
                    <p>This brief description is just the basic configuration of a workflow that may reach different levels of complexity. But in any case, it demands from geophysicist in charge three critical skills:​</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><b class="bold">Familiarity with geophysical techniques involved​</b></li>
                        <li><b class="bold">Understanding of the limitations of input data set​</b></li>
                        <li><b class="bold">Training in working on a multi-disciplinary environment​</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The latter is another way of expressing that geophysical techniques are not self-sufficient, but need the support of other disciplines  -sedimentology, petrophysics ang geology in general- to produce results that reflect real earth conditions.​</p>
                    
                    <p>Geology -the petroleum system to be more precise-  explains the occurrence of economical hydrocarbon accumulations. So, it is not about reaching a “magic attribute that finds oil”  but the integration to a multidisciplinary predictive system for risk minimizing instead. In other words, only by the contribution to geological knowledge is that Geophysics does help.​</p>
